* Phase-2 Report: A Detailed Technical Progress Overview
*Authors*: /Anton Hibl, Ethan Wilcox/

** Introduction

Phase-2 of the project has built upon the solid foundation laid in Phase-1, with
a focus on expanding functionalities, refining user experience, and enhancing
security measures. This stage was marked by iterative development, rigorous
testing, and effective collaboration among the team members. 

** Frontend Development

*** Features and Functionalities
    - Gallery Component Development: The Gallery component was designed and
      developed to display individual ArtworkCards, providing an immersive
      browsing experience for the users. 
    - ArtworkCard and ArtworkDetail Components Development: The representation
      of individual artworks and their detailed view was implemented, allowing
      users to explore and appreciate the artworks in depth.
    - UserAccount Component Development: The UserAccount component was developed
      for managing user profile details and uploaded artworks, offering users a
      personalized and manageable space. 
    - Transition to Material-UI: To ensure a more consistent and robust UI, the
      components were refactored to use Material-UI instead of Fluent UI. 

*** Design Components and Wireframes
The wireframes were updated to reflect the new components and changes in the
user interface. The components were further refined to ensure a cohesive and
intuitive user experience. 

** Backend Development

*** Features and Functionalities
    - Enhanced User Authentication: The user authentication process was improved
      with the addition of a GET endpoint for the `/register` route, providing a
      graphical way for users to sign up. 
    - Artwork Model: An Artwork model was implemented to manage the artworks in
      the database, facilitating efficient data handling. 
    - VerifyToken Middleware: A middleware function was developed to verify
      tokens, enhancing the security of the application by ensuring only
      authenticated users can access certain routes. 

*** Secure Design Considerations
    - Token Verification: The VerifyToken middleware was used to verify the
      `auth-token` in the headers of requests, ensuring secure access to certain
      endpoints. 
    - Secure Routing: Routes were implemented for all the client components,
      ensuring a secure and seamless navigation experience for the users. 

** Integration of Client and Server
The backend and frontend were integrated by connecting the API with the frontend
components. The user flow was streamlined, providing a smooth and intuitive
experience from registration to browsing the gallery. 

** Test-Driven Development (TDD)
The testing suite was expanded to cover the new functionalities:
    - Unit Tests: Additional unit tests were written for the new functions and
      methods. 
    - Integration Tests: New integration tests were developed to test the
      interactions between the new components and the backend. 
    - End-to-End Tests: The end-to-end tests were updated to cover the new user
      flow and functionalities. 

** Changes and Adjustments
As the project evolved, several changes and adjustments were made:
    - Transition to Material-UI: The decision to switch from Fluent UI to
      Material-UI was made to ensure a more consistent and robust user
      interface. 
    - Routing Adjustments: The routing was adjusted to reflect the new user flow
      and to ensure secure access to certain routes. 

** Challenges and Overcoming Them
Phase-2 presented its own set of challenges:
    - UI Library Transition: The transition from Fluent UI to Material-UI
      required a thorough understanding of the new library and careful
      refactoring of the components. 
    - Secure Routing: Implementing secure routing required a nuanced approach
      and careful testing to ensure only authenticated users can access certain
      routes. 

** Lessons Learned
Key takeaways from Phase-2 include:
    - The Importance of Flexibility: The ability to adapt to changes and new
      requirements played a crucial role in the successful completion of this
      phase. 
    - Value of Security: A consistent focus on security ensured a product that
      not only delivers in terms of functionality and design but also in terms
      of user privacy and data integrity. 

** Conclusion

Phase-2 of the project has seen the successful expansion of functionalities,
refinement of user experience, and enhancement of security measures. The team's
commitment to best practices, continuous learning, and collaboration has led to
the successful completion of this phase and set the stage for the final phase of
the project. The lessons learned will/would continue to guide the development as we
move forward, with a focus on delivering a product that excels in terms of
quality, functionality, and design.
